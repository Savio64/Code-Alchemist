## 🧩 Problem Description

Briefly describe the problem you are addressing. 
With the rapid growth of online payments, e-commerce, and digital services, cyber fraud and online scams have increased drastically. Many users—especially first-time internet users, students, and elderly people—fall victim to fake messages, phishing links, fraudulent calls, and deceptive websites. These scams result in financial loss, identity theft, and emotional distress.The major issue is that users lack awareness and real-time tools to identify suspicious digital content before taking action. As a result, people unknowingly share personal details, OTPs, or banking information with fraudsters.

Explain the background and why this problem is relevant.
India and many other countries are rapidly moving toward digital economies. UPI payments, online banking, shopping apps, and social media platforms are now part of daily life. While this digital shift has improved convenience, it has also created new opportunities for cybercriminals.Scammers use realistic-looking SMS messages, emails, WhatsApp links, and fake websites to trick users. These messages often appear to be from trusted sources such as banks, delivery services, government portals, or popular brands, making it difficult for ordinary users to identify what is genuine and what is fraudulent.

  •	Cyber fraud cases are increasing every year.
	•	Financial scams cause loss of money, personal data, and trust in digital systems.
	•	Vulnerable users such as senior citizens, rural populations, and new internet users are the most affected.
	•	Existing solutions are either too technical or not easily accessible to common users.
